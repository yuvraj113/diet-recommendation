A Diet Recommendation App using Content-Based Approach with Scikit-Learn, FastAPI and Streamlit


The main goal of the "Diet Recommendation System" project is to use data analytics and artificial intelligence to revolutionize how people view nutrition. The system customizes dietary recommendations using individualized algorithms that take into account specific user information such as age, gender, medical background, and dietary preferences. The project gives users the ability to make knowledgeable decisions about their diet and general health by guaranteeing accuracy and dependability through evidence-based research. The system is made to be user-friendly on multiple platforms and encourages eco-conscious food choices with an emphasis on accessibility and sustainability. The project's ultimate goal is to improve each person's well-being by offering dietary guidance that is realistic, individualized, and actionable.
